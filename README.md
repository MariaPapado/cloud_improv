First trained model on NatFuel NatGrid building dataset
  scripts: train_builds.py   test_builds.py

    builds trained model: /cephfs/work/maria/cloud_detection/trained_weights/net_11.pt


Then using the model trained on buildings i trained for clouds with scripts:
    train.py    test.py

    clouds trained_model: /cephfs/work/maria/cloud_detection/trained_weights/net_18.pt
